[Saheena](saheena) is a Trini specialty consisting of flour, split peas powder, saffron, baking powder, and salt. The ingredients are mixed together into a paste which is then placed on taro leaves. The process is repeated and the taro leaves are rolled together, then boiled or steamed.  When the concoction has cooled, it is then sliced and fried until golden. The dish is typically served with sauces or chutneys, which are inserted in a split saheena fritter.
